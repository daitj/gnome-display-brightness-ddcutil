# Display Brightness & HDR Toggle

This is a fork of the original [Display Brightness Slider](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2645/brightness-control-using-ddcutil/) extension, modified to add robust support for monitors with High Dynamic Range (HDR).

## Key Features of this Fork

*   **Automatic HDR Detection**: The extension now uses `gdctl` to automatically detect if a connected monitor is HDR-capable and whether HDR mode is currently active.
*   **Seamless Brightness Control**:
    *   In standard (SDR) mode, brightness is controlled using `ddcutil`, preserving the original extension's functionality.
    *   In High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, brightness is controlled by manipulating the `output-luminance` setting via `gsettings`, which is the native method for HDR brightness on modern GNOME desktops.
*   **HDR Toggle**: For any monitor that reports HDR capabilities, a toggle switch is added to the extension's menu. This allows you to easily enable or disable HDR mode directly from the top bar.
    *   The toggle intelligently preserves your current resolution and refresh rate when switching modes.
*   **Configurable Visibility**: You can choose to show or hide the HDR toggle via a new option in the extension's settings (`General > Show HDR Toggle`).

This fork aims to provide a single, unified solution for controlling display brightness across both SDR and HDR modes without needing separate scripts or manual commands.

## Setup ddcutil

1. install `ddcutil`

2. Manually load kernel module `i2c-dev`

```sh

sudo modprobe i2c-dev

```

3. Verify that your monitor supports brightness control

```sh

ddcutil capabilities | grep "Feature: 10"

```

4. udev rule for giving group i2c RW permission on the `/dev/i2c` devices

ddcutil 2.0+
```sh

sudo cp /usr/share/ddcutil/data/60-ddcutil-i2c.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

```
**Note: Fedora 40+ users, you need to uncomment this line**
```
# KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="i2c", MODE="0660"
```

Prior ddcutil 1.4.0
```sh

sudo cp /usr/share/ddcutil/data/45-ddcutil-i2c.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

```

5. Create i2c group and add yourself

```sh

sudo groupadd --system i2c

sudo usermod $USER -aG i2c

```

6. load `i2c-dev` automatically

```sh

sudo touch /etc/modules-load.d/i2c.conf

sudo sh -c 'echo "i2c-dev" >> /etc/modules-load.d/i2c.conf'

```

7. Reboot for changes to take effect

```sh

sudo reboot

```

This tool uses ddcutil as backend, so first make sure that your user can use use following shell commands without root or sudo.

`ddcutil getvcp 10` to check the brightness of a monitor and

`ddcutil setvcp 10 100` to set the brightness to 100

It automatically supports multiple displays detected by

`ddcutil detect`


## Installation

### Automatically from GNOME extensions
You can find this extension [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2645/brightness-control-using-ddcutil/)

### Manually from the source code
Clone this repo and in the repo's root directory run these shell commands

```sh
make build
make install
```

## Troubleshoot

### Screen hangs/locks on first startup
In my hardware for some reason when `ddcutil detect` is ran for the first time after a cold boot and then, when it checks for i2c busno=1, whole system locks for couple of seconds.
As a workaround I changed this extension to read cached info from a file, when it exists.

```sh
ddcutil --brief detect > $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ddcutil_detect
```
### Docking or Daisy chain

If you using a dock and are having issues:

Read more about issues with dock [ddcutil.com FAQ](https://www.ddcutil.com/faq/#docking)

Also some docks use daisy chaining behind the scenes.

If you are daisy chaining the monitors i.e. instead of connecting each monitor to the GPU/Laptop directly, you are connecting monitor to another monitor. Then try to tweak the extension settings `Advanced settings` > `ddcutil Sleep Multipler ms`. Daisy chain doesn't allow running parallel instance of ddcutil.


### Cannot detect display

If you have issues detecting the display and stuck in "Initializing", check if disabling display state check from extension settings `Advanced settings` > `Disable Display State Check` works.

If you find your monitor listed on [rockowitz/ddcutil repo wiki](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/wiki/Notes-on-Specific-Monitors), check what is recommended for your monitor.
