## Setup ddcutil

1. install `ddcutil`

2. Manually load kernel module `i2c-dev`

```sh

sudo modprobe i2c-dev

```

3. Verify that your monitor supports brightness control

```sh

ddcutil capabilities | grep "Feature: 10"

```

4. udev rule for giving group i2c RW permission on the `/dev/i2c` devices

ddcutil 2.0+
```sh

sudo cp /usr/share/ddcutil/data/60-ddcutil-i2c.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

```
Prior ddcutil 1.4.0
```sh

sudo cp /usr/share/ddcutil/data/45-ddcutil-i2c.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

```

5. Create i2c group and add yourself

```sh

sudo groupadd --system i2c

sudo usermod $USER -aG i2c

```

6. load `i2c-dev` automatically

```sh

sudo touch /etc/modules-load.d/i2c.conf

sudo sh -c 'echo "i2c-dev" >> /etc/modules-load.d/i2c.conf'

```

7. Reboot for changes to take effect

```sh

sudo reboot

```

This tool uses ddcutil as backend, so first make sure that your user can use use following shell commands without root or sudo.

`ddcutil getvcp 10` to check the brightness of a monitor and

`ddcutil setvcp 10 100` to set the brightness to 100

It automatically supports multiple displays detected by

`ddcutil detect`


## Installation

### Automatically from GNOME extensions
You can find this extension [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2645/brightness-control-using-ddcutil/)

### Manually from the source code
Clone this repo and in the repo's root directory run these shell commands

```sh
make build
make install
```

## Issues

### Screen hangs/locks on first startup
In my hardware for some reason when `ddcutil detect` is ran for the first time after a cold boot and then, when it checks for i2c busno=1, whole system locks for couple of seconds.
As a workaround I changed this extension to read cached info from a file, when it exists.

```sh
ddcutil --brief detect > $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ddcutil_detect
```
